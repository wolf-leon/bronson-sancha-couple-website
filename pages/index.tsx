const words = `
On Sancha's 21st birthday, Bronson and Sancha realized their love for each other and decided they were made for each other. It was their time, and they were officially engaged. From that day onwards, they began their journey of making memories, exploring new places, sharing adventures, and building a life together filled with love, joy, and endless possibilities. Their story is one of love, commitment, and the beautiful journey of two souls destined to be together. 

And now, with hearts full of gratitude and dreams intertwined, Bronson and Sancha have taken the next step â€” they are officially married. What began as a spark of young love has blossomed into a lifelong promise. Together, they look forward to writing new chapters of laughter, togetherness, and everlasting love â€” hand in hand, forever and always.

            dearest to us, we stood before each other to celebrate the sacred
            bond of marriage. Surrounded by family, friends, and heartfelt

            the life we&apos;ve built and the dreams we&apos;ll continue to
